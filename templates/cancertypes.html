                Cancer incidence and mortality statistics reported by the National Cancer Institute and other resources
                were used to create the list.1 To qualify as a common cancer for the list, the estimated annual
                incidence for 2023 had to be 40,000 cases or more.

                The most common type of cancer on the list is breast cancer, with 300,590 new cases expected in the
                United States in 2023. The next most common cancers are prostate cancer and lung cancer.

                Because colon and rectal cancers are often referred to as "colorectal cancers," these two cancer types
                are combined for the list. For 2023, the estimated number of new cases of colon cancer and rectal cancer
                are 106,970 and 46,050, respectively, adding to a total of 153,020 new cases of colorectal cancer
